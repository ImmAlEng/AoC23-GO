# Advent of Code in Go

This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code 2023 challenges implemented in the Go programming language. Advent of Code is an annual coding event with daily programming challenges that are released in the days leading up to Christmas.

## Structure

The repository is organized by Day, with each Day containing individual folders for each puzzles's challenge.

## Running Solutions

To run a specific day's solution, navigate to the corresponding folder and use the `go run` command after adding a input.txt file to the corresponding Days directory:

```bash
cd DayX/pX
go run main.go
